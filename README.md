This program counts the number of lines in your code and returns the total lines, comment, empty and coded lines(ones containing actual code).


# Installation 
npm i line-counter-cli

# Run the command
npm line-counter


One issue i noticed with this first version is that it counts lines in picture png files(I dont know how that happened)
but I'd surely fix it by the next release.

This is the first version and I would like us all to test and use it.
Your feedbacks are highlyyyyyyyyyyy welcome.

Feel free to raise an issue and also fork or fix if you would love to.
